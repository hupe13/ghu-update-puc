If you have installed any plugins from hupe13 hosted on Github, you can receive the updates here.

== Description ==

This plugin is a further development of [leafext-update-github](https://github.com/hupe13/leafext-update-github).
Back then, I only had two plugins on Github. Now there are a few more.
The function remains the same: the plugin handles updates for all my WordPress plugins hosted on GitHub.

== Installation ==

* Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/hupe13/ghu-update-puc/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and install it on the plugin page of your WordPress installation.
* Activate it.
* Go in the admin menu to Settings - Github Update PUC and set a Github Token if needed.
* You will get updates with the [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker).
